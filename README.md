The project involves a photography competition website where the primary functionalities include displaying submitted photos on the home page and a form on the "Submit a photo" page for users to enter the contest; the security aspects to be tested focus on form validation to ensure correct user submissions and the integrity of a "like" system, aiming to prevent multiple likes from the same user and exploring potential security vulnerabilities like HTML injections or overly long text entries
